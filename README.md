## Styling Concepts Used
- **Color & Background-color**: Used to style text, buttons, and the main page background.
- **Border & Border-radius**: Applied to profile image, input fields, and buttons for rounded and defined shapes.
- **Margin & Padding**: Used to create spacing between elements.
- **Centering**: Elements like heading, buttons, and images are centered using `text-align` and margin adjustments.
- **Box-model**: Managed width, height, padding, and borders to maintain layout consistency.

## Responsive Design

- Input fields and buttons resize to fit smaller window widths.
- Navigation links stack vertically on small screens for better usability.
